# Udacity Data Science Capstone

This is my repository for the Udacity Data Science Capstone. I decided to work on the Greate Energy Prediction ccompetition on Kaggle.

## Libraries

The libraries needed to run the code are:
- Pandas & Numpy for managing and working with data
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualizing data
- LightGBM for training Gradient Boosted Decision Trees
- Tqdm for logging during training

## Code structure
